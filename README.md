# General_Human_Issues
This is a repository that lists those general human issues that waiting for solving.

## Mosquito (蚊子
If you got bite wherever you go, how can you live happyly?

Why mosquito bite human for thousands of years, and human still couldn't let it dispear from earth?

Why's the point of those high tech If they can't even destroy small mosquitos?

> 为什么人类文明进化到了这个程度，世界上还有蚊子？走到哪儿都能被蚊子咬？一被咬就难受。~~世界上是不是只有我一个肉体人类？~~

## Dandruff, Dermatitis (头皮屑，皮炎
Why you have to care your head dandruff or face dermatitis condition for each day by washing them using water?

Can't it get solved once for all?

> 头皮屑、脸皮发炎，都是细菌引起的，每天用抑菌剂清洗就能解决。但这没有从源头解决问题，为什么环境中那么多细菌？这个问题在困扰人类每一天，一天不洗，就很难受。

## 36 degree fixed temperature water supply machine (36度恒温供水机
According to my research, most of those products in the market, they say they can provide 36 degree fixed temperature water machine for you to take showering, in the end, what you get is water that has temperature higher than 42 degree, which is scarying.

> 说好的恒温热水器，结果不管你怎么折腾，最终都给你输出高于42度的热水，皮肤都烫熟了，怎么安心洗澡？(人体需要36.5度的恒温热水用于洗澡)

## Sound Noise (生活噪音
According to my feeling, for most every city, they always has loud noises near the street.

It seems like not every building uses noise cancelling tech to decrease the noises.

> 靠近马路，总是有很大的噪音，就算住在十几层楼都能听得到。并不是所有的大厦都采用了隔音玻璃。希望这一点在20年后能得到改善。
